#Integral Approximating Applet

1.The "Project" folder contains a folder with a project importable to Eclipse.
The same folder should be specified as root-folder in Eclipse when importing.

...\Projekt\src - folder with files containing source codes (.java extension)
...\Projekt\bin\src - folder with result files (.class extension)


2.The AppletRun folder contains the result files and an html file with a "built-in" applet ready to be opened in a browser
(after prior Java (JRE) configuration) or placed on the server.

Please note that newer versions of jdk may not support AppletViever class, although older versions of Java might be required, preferably Java 8 but Java 9 or 10 should work as well.
Also, there is an option to run Java applet without installing Java by using browser extension "CheerpJ Applet Runner".
